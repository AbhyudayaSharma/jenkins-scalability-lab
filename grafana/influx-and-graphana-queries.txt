# Useful query samples

SELECT "usage_iowait" FROM "autogen"."cpu" WHERE "cpu" = 'cpu-total' AND $timeFilter

# Graphana
SELECT "io_time" FROM "autogen"."diskio" WHERE "name" = 'vda' AND $timeFilter

# Grafana query builder for IOtime
# Can do FROM autogen, diskio where name = vda
select field(io_time) derivative(10s) - to get IOtime per tick!

# For grafana to show all points, remove the "group by" condition


# Metrics of interest:
- vm.timed_waiting.count and vm.*.count are threads?

# Get all load generator measurements matching a regex, to use as query variables
SHOW MEASUREMENTS with measurement =~ /.*loadgenerator.*/

Set up variable for generator name from that and variable is bound to 'all' and that is set to the default
