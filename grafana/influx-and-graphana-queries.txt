SELECT "usage_iowait" FROM "autogen"."cpu" WHERE "cpu" = 'cpu-total' AND $timeFilter

# Graphana
SELECT "io_time" FROM "autogen"."diskio" WHERE "name" = 'vda' AND $timeFilter

# Grafana query builder for IOtime
# Can do FROM autogen, diskio where name = vda
select field(io_time) derivative(10s) - to get IOtime per tick!

# For grafana to show all points, remove the "group by" condition
