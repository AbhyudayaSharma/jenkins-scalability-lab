# Metrics to filter 
- jenkins.project.*  (useless project metrics)

# Metrics of interest
- jenkins.job.scheduled -- rate jobs are scheduled
    + for load generator that will be the rate they are completed, after the initial ramp-up (handy!)
    + m1_rate == jobs per minute

- QueueStats for queueing issues
- NodeStats for DurableTask efficiency
- job.building.duration.count 
    + parallel builds
    + Derivative = concurrent builds (default is 1 min sampling)
- job.building.duration.p50 = median build time in minutes
    + But need to average over a longer interval for longer jobs
    + However it seems to be reporting completely useless timings:
        * i.e. 1.3 for 15 second builds - artifact of sampling interval of 5 seconds, so not enough builds complete?
    + job.building.duration.m5_rate gives more consistent numbers but they do not add up!
        * 3 concurrency, 1 secondish builds (maybe 1.5) gives about 263
        * 3 concurrency, 15 second builds gives about 24

- TODO:
    + Add a metrics meter for job *completion* rate
